"I almost ignored this..
When I saw my face on a billboard in Times Square, my first instinct was to brush it off. 
I thought, ""𝘐𝘵’𝘴 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘴𝘶𝘤𝘩 𝘢 𝘣𝘪𝘨 𝘥𝘦𝘢𝘭. 𝘐𝘵'𝘴 𝘫𝘶𝘴𝘵 𝘢𝘯𝘰𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘳 𝘮𝘪𝘭𝘦𝘴𝘵𝘰𝘯𝘦.""
But then, I stopped.

As an international student Columbia University, I came to the US🇺🇸 in 2021 with nothing but hope. 
✘ No experience.
✘ No safety net. 
✘ No idea how to write a single line of code. 
✘ I didn’t know how I’d make a living, let alone pay rent.

There were countless nights where I lay awake, consumed by imposter syndrome, wondering if I was good enough, if I even belonged.

So, seeing my face in Times Square was surreal🌱

I almost didn’t let myself be proud of it...
I almost didn’t celebrate it...

But this moment reminded me of how far I’ve come. 😌

Sometimes, we forget to celebrate our wins—big or small. 
We get caught up in what’s next, in what we still haven’t achieved, that we forget how much we’ve already accomplished.

So, here I am, proud of my journey and ready to embrace the wins, no matter how big or small.

I want to thank my parents, who believed in me when I couldn’t believe in myself. To my friends, who supported me through every high and low. To my manager who took a chance on me. And to you, my LinkedIn fam who’s been a part of this journey—I couldn’t have made it here without you.

To every international student, dreamer, or anyone struggling to believe in themselves—your journey matters. 

Keep going. You’re closer than you think.💙

Thanks for the expert feature topmate.io"
"It is happening!

We kicked off Week 1 by 𝘉𝘶𝘪𝘭𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘋𝘈𝘎𝘴 𝘰𝘯 𝘈𝘱𝘢𝘤𝘩𝘦 𝘈𝘪𝘳𝘧𝘭𝘰𝘸!!

Apache Airflow is the simplest yet the most powerful tool for
⇨ Automating complex workflows with ease
⇨ Managing and scheduling tasks across a variety of systems
⇨ Creating scalable and maintainable data pipelines
⇨ Monitoring and tracking task progress with detailed logs

I'm excited about hosting and building more Data Eng pipelines
through DataDrooler Community.

"You’ll fail if you stop!

For 20 years, I believed this…
But last week changed everything!!!

I ran my first 22kms at the NYC Half Marathon. 
It was hard, and unlike most people, I took many breaks!

I was slow, steady, and did it in multiple sprints.
and.. I felt guilty about sprinting! 

I must not stop I thought — before going into the race 
but then I realized that I should let go!

How often do we push ourselves to the point of burnout, believing that stopping means failure?

In life, we’re told to keep going, no matter what. 
But what if, success isn’t about never stopping... 
What if It’s about knowing when to pause, recharge, and then sprint forward with purpose..

I may have been slower than others, but I crossed the finish line🏁 at my own pace!

(And surprisingly hit many PRs😳)"
"Six months ago, I couldn’t even run a mile.
This Sunday, I’m running 13.1. (still can’t believe it!)

Growing up, I was never the kid into sports. 
Running? Absolutely not..... 

So if you asked me why I’m doing this now, 
I’d probably laugh and say, “𝘉𝘦𝘤𝘢𝘶𝘴𝘦 𝘐 𝘴𝘪𝘨𝘯𝘦𝘥 𝘶𝘱.”

And that’s the thing—sometimes, you don’t wait until you feel ready. 
-> You commit first
-> You show up
-> You figure it out along the way....

My Training wasn’t perfect. I missed runs. I had doubts (still have..😅)
But progress isn’t about perfect execution—it’s about consistency, resilience, and showing up even when you don’t feel prepared.

This applies to running, careers, learning new skills—everything.

If you’re waiting to feel ready, you might be waiting forever. Just start.

Sunday will be tough, but I’m showing up 🏃🏻‍♀️‍➡️....

✅ P.S: If you’ve been waiting for the “𝙧𝙞𝙜𝙝𝙩 𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙚” to start learning Data Engineering—this is your sign. 
Doors close tonight! Show up here → https://datadrooler.com/"
"I accidentally got a Data Engineering interview—and I was NOT ready for it. 😬

When I was job-hunting, I only applied to Data Science / Data Analyst roles.

I had no idea what Data Engineering was—and honestly? I didn’t care.

After 90 days of nonstop applications, I finally landed an interview… only for the role to close before I even had a chance.

Then the recruiter pointed me to this other role—one I had never even considered.

That’s how I ended up in my first Data Engineering interview—completely unprepared!

My advice?
 ✅ Apply to as many relevant roles as possible. (Check 400+ job postings👇)
 ✅ Be prepared with real-world projects to talk about. (DM me for details!)

Opportunities can come from anywhere!
Make sure you're ready when they do😌"

"You don’t need to be an expert.
You just need one solid project.

A lot of people overcomplicate their transition into Data Engineering.

🚫  ""I need to master every tool."" → No, you need one good project.
🚫 ""I don’t have time to learn everything."" → You don’t need to.
🚫  ""I’ll start when I’m ready."" → No one ever feels ""ready.""

The first step? Building something 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐥.

"I wasted 6 months learning Data Engineering the wrong way.
I thought:

❌ ""I'll just take a Udemy course."" → Didn’t help with real projects.
❌ ""SQL + Python is enough."" → Nope. Employers want real experience.
❌ ""I'll follow a roadmap."" → Roadmaps are generic. Hiring managers aren’t.

The right way to learn?
- Start by actually building a pipeline (even a basic one).
- Learn the tools that companies actually use (Airflow, Azure, AWS).
- Get feedback from people in the field instead of just tutorials.

If you've been stuck in the ""learning loop"" then join my upcoming DE workshop.

"Last week, I spoke at Lightning AI x Datadog event and
It was amazing!!

AI Agents & Agentic Workflows are disrupting EVERYTHING!

Traditional Data Pipelines 
- follow predefined rules
- are static (breaks if API/format changes)
- have no decision-making capabilities

Agentic Workflows are
- use LLMs to build on rules
- self-adjust to changes (via LLM reasoning)
- Dynamically prioritizes tasks and make own decisions

Traditional data pipelines are boring but sturdy.
Agentic Workflows are fast but unreliable.

There is no one without the other. What do you think?"

- Build products, not just projects.
- Put them in the hands of real users.
- Create impact.

Yeah – even I was shocked to hear this recently from a YouTuber.
I couldn’t sleep thinking about it since I’m betting my career on the field.

Guess what I did?

As any *sane* data person, I went online, collected data on 500 data engineering job postings, and analyzed them.

And with that, I got an answer to the question:
Is Data Engineering still relevant in 2025?

Don't panic – if you have the same question, I made a complete video on the analysis. 

And the best part? 
It can be used for analyzing any job title you want.

- you create a table without a DDL script and hope no one notices

"I’ve been struggling with FEAR Of JUDGEMENT my whole life and.. no I’ve not overcome this yet.
But here’s the thing-
A little fear is good for you no?

I’ve learnt that when you fear judgement from people you tend to 
✅ Be more proactive 
✅ Learn “new” things
✅ Be open to change 
✅ Learn to take criticism better
✅ Push yourself harder to do more and be more

But don’t get me wrong..
Too much of something is not good either!

When you let other people have control over what you do and what you think, you become a character in a movie that says “Written by xxx”

Instead take charge of what you want and just be who you want to be.

Don’t get too comfortable with what they’re thinking..
Own your mind.

I’m slowly taking charge myself :)

Step 4: Design Storage Solutions (aka —cloud or basement, your choice!)
Step 5: Implement Monitoring and Maintenance (ofc it's gonna break)

It's that simple.
Is it?"

3. Local LLMs
4. Personal Use
5. AI agents 

I’ve realized there are multiple projects that can be done within these segments using LLM capabilities.

"When I started, I had no idea what data engineering truly involved.

Looking back, there are 5 crucial lessons I wish I’d learned sooner:

1. The Learning Curve is Steep - So hang in there
Getting up to speed takes time and patience.

2. Automation & Documentation can be real game-changers. 
Automating repetitive tasks and keeping thorough documentation can save you a ton of time.

3. Setting realistic goals and communicating effectively can help you avoid stress and over-promising especially if you are starting off. 

4. Projects often come with incomplete requirements and changing data. Navigating uncertainty is a vital skill. 

5. Knowing the business context behind the data makes problem-solving faster and more relevant. 

What’s one lesson you’ve learned in your career that you wish you knew earlier?

"Many Data Engineering aspirants ask me: 
""What's the right way to learn Data Engineering? 
 Is it by reading books or by doing projects?""

I always say: ""Both.""

What do I mean by that?

There are a lot of Data Engineering books on Amazon. I mean a lot. It can get overwhelming to select the right book.

I got an interesting idea.

Why not build a data pipeline to grab the books and store them in a database?! That way, I can analyze and find the right book for me.

Hit two targets with one shot. Theory + Practice !

Curious to build your first data pipeline and get a database of Data Engineering books?

Watch this video for a step-by-step guide to building your first data pipeline :"
"Interesting opportunity!

I’m looking for a part-time freelancer who can help me with data collection/ data-entry/ QA testing for a prototype project that I am working on.

Ideal Eligibility- Students in 1st/2nd/3rd year undergrad

This is a paid position.

"Are you a beginner trying to learn Data Engineering?

Then you might have these questions:
- Is Data Engineering truly popular?
- How crucial is experience to break into the field?
- What skills are currently in high demand?
- What's the comprehensive average salary range?
- What are the widespread responsibilities associated with the role?
- Are there certifications that can give you an edge?

I was curious to know where Data Engineering is headed to in 2024!
This is why I scraped 1000 Data Engineering jobs and I found answers to these questions.

Excited to announce that I've launched my first youtube video 🎉

"Here are 5 mistakes I made as an international student. And what I wish I had done instead 

A) Underestimating the power of Focus
During my grad school days, it was easy to get lost in the details and sometimes assignments and projects seemed so overwhelming to complete.

Something I wish I had done sooner is to implement the Pomodoro Technique - Do a task as if you were going to finish it in 25 mins and then you’ll see you don’t find it that overwhelming. 
This technique lets you focus on finishing just the basics first and then you can delve later into the details.

B) Lacking Financial Wisdom:
Financial wisdom is crucial for international students.
 I would have been better off if I had taken these steps:
- Obtaining a credit card early to build a strong credit score for future rental leases.
- Acquiring my Social Security Number (SSN) promptly to receive payments faster.
- Stop converting everything to rupees( just stop, it doesn't help)

C) Not strategizing Job search
I wish someone told me how important it is to track and manage job applications from day one, and staying organized throughout the process. Doing this helps you in keeping tabs on productivity, follow-ups, and interview schedules, making your job search journey more efficient and less stressful. 

🌟 Don’t get caught in the Entry Level paradox
No matter what you are telling yourself, try applying for that job that you think you are under qualified for and life might just surprise you :)

D)Looking for <$5 food alternatives 
Spend a little extra on food if you have to.
In my quest for budget-friendly meals, I often settled for less satisfying options under $5. Looking back, I would have advised myself to spend a bit more on quality food. A well-fed student is a happy student!

E) Staying mindful of upcoming holidays
🎃Halloween, Thanksgiving etc were some local holidays that I wish I made myself aware of become they actually came in. This would've allowed me to plan my schedule around it earlier.

"To all jobseekers: Here’s why you need a professional portfolio website and how you can create one(instantly)

Context - Your online presence matters more than ever, especially while job hunting. That's where a professional portfolio website comes into play. 
📌 Showcase Beyond Your Resume: Your portfolio goes beyond the limitations of a traditional resume. Display your skills, projects, and personality in a way that words alone can't capture.
📌 Demonstrate Initiative: Having a portfolio website shows potential employers that you're proactive and tech-savvy, setting you apart from the competition.
📌 24/7 Visibility: Your portfolio is your online face; it's there for recruiters to see anytime, anywhere.

However..

Often, people don’t have it as 
- Creating a portfolio takes ""Time"" (and as jobseekers, we don't have much)
- Web Development is not exactly easy
- Unsure of where to host it etc.

🚀If you want to create a portfolio in a few minutes then we have been working on a solution for you.

How? Fill a form (about 3 mins) and voila, your portfolio is ready(instantly)!

"Data engineering is a crucial aspect of the data lifecycle, responsible for collecting, transforming, and storing data in a way that makes it accessible, reliable, and usable for analysis and decision-making.
Here are some key basics of data engineering:

1. Data Collection:
- Data Sources: Identify the sources of data, which can include databases, APIs, sensors, logs, and external datasets.
- Data Extraction: Extract data from various sources using technologies like ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools, APIs, web scraping, etc.

2. Data Transformation:

- Data Cleaning: Cleanse and preprocess data to remove errors, duplicates, inconsistencies, and missing values.
- Data Integration: Combine data from multiple sources into a unified format, addressing variations in schema and data types.
- Data Enrichment: Enhance data by adding additional information, such as geographic data, demographics, or external data.
- Data Transformation: Apply transformations to the data to make it compatible with the target system, such as converting formats, aggregating, and reshaping.

3. Data Storage:

- Data Warehouses: Store processed data in data warehouses designed for querying and analysis, such as Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, or Snowflake.
- Data Lakes: Store raw and processed data in data lakes

4. Data Processing:

- Batch Processing: Perform data transformations and analysis on large volumes of data in scheduled batches.
- Stream Processing: Process and analyze data in real-time as it arrives, using tools like Apache Kafka, Event hub etc

5. Data Quality and Governance:

- Data Validation: Ensure data accuracy and quality through validation checks and error handling.
- Metadata Management: Maintain metadata to document data lineage, transformations, and relationships.
- Data Security and Compliance: Implement security measures and adhere to data privacy regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, etc.

6. Data Pipeline:

- Data Pipelines: Create data pipelines to automate the flow of data from source to storage and processing.
- Orchestration Tools: Use tools like Apache Airflow, Azure Data Factory or Kubernetes to schedule, monitor, and manage data pipeline workflows.

7. Scalability and Performance:

- Horizontal Scalability: Design systems that can scale horizontally by adding more machines or nodes.
- Partitioning: Distribute data across different partitions for efficient storage and processing.

8. Cloud Computing:

- Cloud Services: Utilize cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud for storage, processing, and scalability.
- Serverless Architecture: Leverage serverless computing for auto-scaling and reduced infrastructure management.

Data engineering is essential for preparing data for analysis, reporting, and machine learning.

"My weekend project has reached a milestone of over 100 users in just a week! 🎉 

As an international student, finding my first job in the US was challenging. Not only because of the tough job market but also because of the 100 other things that were on my plate at the time. I was catching up with coursework, part time jobs, networking and an umpteen number of other things associated with surviving in a new country. My life as a jobseeker was tougher than I expected.

When I got my first job, I was elated with joy, and deep inside, I knew what I wanted to do - help ease the pressure on international students who come to the US in search of new opportunities.

During my jobhunt days, I submitted over 500 applications. After a point, I honestly lost track of what roles I was applying to and this made me feel directionless. I started using an Excel tracker to store all job role related details. Though this was a hassle, it made me more confident. 🌱 

After applying to a role, I would manually copy all the important aspects related to a role onto this sheet, so that I would be prepared and would tailor my answers according to the description when that interview call finally came in. 

JotterWolf was born out of the need to make this process seamless and effortless. It took 14 weekends of continuous development for Hari and I to build JotterWolf.

3 months ago, if someone had told me that we'd onboard over 100 users in just one week, I might have laughed in disbelief.

Yet, here we stand, celebrating an exciting milestone. I extend my gratitude to all who've signed up thus far.

Here's to hoping this little project becomes the go-to helper for jobseekers, and helps everyone carve out killer careers! Cheers! 🎉

"🎯 Landing your first job can be challenging!

Getting your first job is an exciting milestone, but let's acknowledge the challenges that often come with it. 

If you're a first-time job seeker, you're not alone in facing these dilemmas. 

Let's dive into some of the most common ones and how to conquer them:

1️⃣ Paradox of Choice
With countless job options available in the market, it's easy to feel overwhelmed and lost!
🌱 Focus on your strengths and interests to narrow down your search. Remember, you don't need to apply to every job – just the ones aligning with your goals.

2️⃣ Experience vs. Entry-Level Roles
Struggling to find a job that matches your skills, but most postings require experience? 
🌱 Remember, entry-level roles are designed for newbies. Tailor your resume to showcase transferable skills gained from internships, volunteering, or coursework.

3️⃣ Imposter Syndrome
Doubting your abilities and fearing you'll be exposed as unqualified? 
🌱 It's natural to feel this way, but remind yourself of your accomplishments. You've got potential, and growth comes with stepping outside your comfort zone.

4️⃣ Networking Anxiety
Meeting professionals can be intimidating. 
🌱 But remember, networking isn't about bragging; it's about building genuine connections. Attend events, engage on LinkedIn, and don't be afraid to ask for informational interviews.

5️⃣ Rejection Blues
Facing rejection can be discouraging. 
🌱 Instead of dwelling on it, treat rejections as learning opportunities. Ask for feedback, adapt your approach, and keep pushing forward.

6️⃣ Salary Negotiation
Navigating salary talks can be daunting. 
🌱 Research industry standards, practice negotiation scripts, and confidently communicate your value. Remember, it's a negotiation, not a confrontation.

7️⃣ Balancing Expectations:
Dream job vs. Reality check. Your first job might not be your dream job, and that's okay! 
🌱 Focus on gaining experience, building skills, and exploring various opportunities.

8️⃣ Job Market Uncertainty
Economic fluctuations like Tech Layoffs can impact job availability. 
🌱 Stay adaptable and open to different roles or industries. Your journey might take unexpected turns that lead to valuable experiences.

Remember, every job seeker faces these challenges at some point. It's all part of the process, and growth happens when you embrace the journey. 

Share your thoughts and experiences below, and let's support each other on this exciting path! 🚀

"🇮🇳✈️🇺🇸 On Aug 15 2021, I first stepped foot at John F Kennedy International Airport, embracing the land of opportunities. 

Even as a child when people asked me what my dream was, I would promptly say, ""I want to study in America"". Two years ago, I was humbled to see my dream come alive when I entered America as a graduate student at Columbia University. 

As I reflect on my 2 year stint in US, I want to share a few key habits I stressed upon during my initial days , that ensured my survival throughout my Masters.

1) Personal Financing💵 - As somebody who was spending $80000 on getting my degree, budgeting and financing was crucial for my survival. I started looking for part-time jobs from the day of my arrival. I prepared a personal tracker to understand my income, spending and savings . It took me 2 months of rigorous searching for jobs before i could fully support myself.

2) Transportation: I predominantly relied on the subway for commuting within the city. At roughly $2.75 per ride, it provided affordable connectivity, especially in NYC. Despite my poor navigational skills🙈, I managed to navigate the vast city.

3) Cooking Skills: Learning to prepare simple, nutritious meals not only saved money but also contributed to my well-being. With a consistent weekly $30 budget for groceries, I minimized ordering takeout. I indulged in exploring various cuisines selectively which helped me cultivate the habit of conscious spending.

4) Legal Knowledge: Understanding what I can and cannot do under my visa helped me stay cautious of any potential mis-steps along the ride. 
For instance: A friend on mine was unaware of the regulations for international students on the number of hours one can work during the week. She ended up working over 20 hrs per week in her part-time - lost legitimate 💰

5) Job Search : I came to the US fresh out of undergrad with only prior internship experience. In the beginning, I was stuck with the paradox of choice - not knowing which role to apply to and ended up making some beginner level mistakes of :

 ❌ Using the same resume to apply for different positions
 ❌ Self rejecting by thinking i may not qualify for the role and so on.
But the biggest mistake was
 ❌ Randomly applying to jobs without actually keep track of details like; how many jobs did I apply to today? , What is my pitch going to be for my first callback ? etc

This cost me the first few callbacks I got. I don't regret anything more than this.
✨✨If you don't want to make the same mistake, please check out JotterWolf . I built this tool for personalized job-application management specifically to help international students. (www.jotterwolf.com)

In conclusion, the past two years have been a period of immense growth and learning. From fulfilling a lifelong dream to embracing challenges head-on, I've evolved both personally and academically.

"From struggling to find part-time jobs upon my arrival in the US to successfully securing positions as a Course Assistant(CA), Research Assistant(RA), and two other on-campus roles, Here I'd like to share a few things that helped me in this process.

Coming from India, my immediate goal upon arriving was to secure a job to support myself financially in the US. But the catch is, if you're on an F1 visa, your options for earning your livelihood are limited to on-campus part-time jobs( for the first two semesters or 8 months).

Here's how I navigated this process:
- Cold Emailing :
While some might say cold emailing is ineffective, in my experience, I obtained more than half of my RA interviews simply by sending an email to the professor. Reaching the right person at the right time is what others may refer to as luck 🍀.

- Being Proactive:
Taking the initiative proved crucial. Many opportunities operate on a first-come, first-served basis. Connecting with current position holders for referrals was a successful tactic.

- Leveraging online platforms: 
Check your university's job portal, department newsletters, and faculty web pages for job listings and updates.

- Being Open to New Roles:
While securing roles like CA, TA, or RA might be competitive, there are numerous other positions available to first-semester students. Keep an eye out for positions like examination proctors, student tutors, and event organizers. Initially, these might seem nonessential, but they harbor valuable experiences that aid in acclimating to life abroad. 

🚫Last but not least, saying no to self-rejection: 
Never underestimate your potential. Avoid dismissing yourself prematurely from any opportunity. You can be surprised with what you are capable of doing!

*FYI - Speaking of jobs, if you're actively looking for your dream job then you would have either submitted a hundred applications already or will be starting to very soon. Get over boring spreadsheets and start tracking them all of them for free by simply downloading the JotterWolf Chrome extension on https://jotterwolf.com/"
"Self Doubt has been a constant companion in my life!

🎓 When I got an Ivy League admit, I doubted if they made a mistake
✈️ When I flew across borders to pursue my Masters, I doubted if I could survive in a new country all by myself
📚 When I attended my first class at Columbia, I doubted if Masters was even for me
📝 When I prepared for my first test, I doubted if I would even pass
🔍 When I started looking for my first internship in Data, I doubted if I would ever get one.
💼 When I started my first job in Data, I doubted if my skills were even good enough
🚀 And now, as I launch to the world, the first product I have ever made, I would be lying if I told you I wasn’t afraid.

I believe it is ok to self-doubt as long as you do it anyway.
There’s a thin line between doubting yourself and giving up on what you aspire to do..
Don’t let self-doubt turn into self-rejection!

"""Studying abroad is a dream for many just like it was for me. One year ago, this time, I remember frantically browsing for GRE/TOEFL self-study strategies and spending sleepless nights preparing countless versions of SoPs. I went through the entire application process by relying on the knowledge I gathered from the internet, and it was EXHAUSTING. ""Only if I had somebody to ask,"" I thought. Now, I want to be that ""Somebody."" Through Gradvine, I wish to help students present their best selves to their dream universities. As a mentor, I hope to be a trusted source of information and a guiding compass for many. From second-guessing my profile to securing an Ivy League admit, I have learned to be self-confident, and I would like to inspire my juniors to be the same.""-Sunjana Ramana

But on the bright side, walking those 10 steps would mean that I would now actually( in flesh and blood) be a Master's Student at Columbia University. I was nervous, yes! but more than that overjoyed beyond words. 

With every step I took towards that door, I couldn't help but feel more grateful than ever to each and every person who made this journey possible, my Professors and mentors from JNTUH College of Engineering Hyderabad for supporting me throughout the application process, and especially to my pillars of strength, my parents who never gave up on the
