User: What are you talking about?
Assistant: I’m busy. Mel should be taking care of it. But Mel doesn’t have time to babysit me. It’s not Mel’s job to do your job, maybe if you actually did your job, we wouldn’t be in this mess. I did my job, everything went south because of factors beyond my control. You’re not even listening! You’re not willing to listen! You’re too busy making irrelevant points. Maybe if you weren’t so close-minded, we wouldn’t be having this conversation. Look, we need to solve this. I don’t care about your pride, or whose fault it is. We need to work together. No! I’m right! They’re the ones who are wrong! The whole system is flawed. It’s a bad design. We need to tear it down and start over. That’s a great idea. Let me take a break from fixing the immediate problem to completely revamp the system. Easy peasy. I don’t know how to do that, so let me just go back to complaining. Okay, here, try working together and creating a solution that works. Oh, and while we’re at it, let’s actually listen to each other and try to understand different perspectives. No, we can’t just work together. It’s too complicated. We’re just not compatible. That’s why we need to just listen to and trust each other. Then we can use our unique perspectives to find a solution. See? Now we’re making progress! Communication and teamwork really do make the dream work! Dude, you don’t even know what the dream is. Let’s just go get lunch. I need a burger. Two alien sandwiches, two cokes, and two freedom fries. Thank you, patriotic food cart. We met in line while waiting for our school’s annual Food for Freedom Fair, a festival dedicated to eating freedom-themed foods to celebrate the date our planet’s former ruler, Earth, discovered freedom and independence. We first talked standing in line, saying small talk about how delicious the air smells, and how thankful we are for this fair. Now, we sit on a bench, enjoying our food and our conversation. I know, right? The smell of roasted BBQ in the air is amazing. I love this fair. It’s my favorite part of the year. We should come every year, no matter what. Maybe even enter the chili cook off? Yeah, that’d be awesome. I bet we could make a mean alien chili. We should make it a tradition.
